This data is from Danielle Galvin's 2021 project where tadpoles of two species were exposed to 1 of 3 concentrations of ranavirus or a control dose. The tadpole species were Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculata) or Northern Leopard Frogs (Rana pipiens). All indidivuals were hand collected from various wetlands including Lost Lake, Pettigrew, and a pond known as Dave's due to it's location near Dr. Swanson's house. The ranavirus concentrations were 0 (control) or 10, 100, or 1000 PFU/mL. Individuals were placed in 50mL water for a 72 hour period during which food was withheld. 

Alive status was recorded once per day for several months. Mass, Gosner stage, and length were recorded 5 times approximately 7-10 days apart. The first measurement occurred on the day of dosing and then 4 instances after.

Lengths are not currently (Nov 6, 2021) a part of this data set as they are still being recorded using ImageJ from photographs taken during the experiment. 

Goals:
1. Researchers have found that infeciton and mortality peak at approximately 10 days. Do we see this? Does it vary by species or by concentration to which they were exposed?
2. How does rate of development change? How does this vary by species or by concentration to which they were exposed?
